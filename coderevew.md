Okay, I have reviewed the code changes and here's my analysis.

## Description
The changes refactor the `Network` struct in `pkg/gonn/mlp.go` to decouple it from the storage mechanism. A new file `pkg/gonn/mlp_storage.go` is introduced to handle the loading and saving of the network's weights. The `Network` struct no longer directly handles file I/O. Instead, the `save` and `load` functions in `mlp_storage.go` take a `Network` instance and serialize/deserialize its state. The `Predict` function is also modified to remove the flavour parameter and instead use the flavour that the network was trained with.

The `PredictFiles` function has been updated to remove the `flavour` parameter, indicating that the flavour is now stored within the loaded network model.

Also the documentation in `docs/README.md` has been updated to reflect the changes in training and predicting a result.

## Obvious errors
1.  **Error Handling in `mlp_storage.go`:** In several places within the `load` function, an error returned by `fileopen.Read` is printed to standard output using `fmt.Println` but not properly handled. The function should return the error so that the caller can handle it appropriately.
2.  **Incomplete removal of model files**: The old code had two model files, but the new code only uses one model file. The `removemodel` function should remove the second model file too.
3.  **Missing error handling in `save`**: The `save` function in `mlp_storage.go` does not handle the error returned by `binary.Write` when writing the training flavour of the network.

## Improvements
1.  **Consistent Error Handling:** Ensure that all errors returned by file operations (e.g., `os.Open`, `os.Create`, `file.Read`, `file.Write`) and binary operations (e.g., `binary.Read`, `binary.Write`) are properly handled. This typically involves logging the error and returning it so that the calling function can take appropriate action.
    ```go
    // in mlp_storage.go
    err = binary.Write(filecreate, binary.LittleEndian, int64(net.flavour))
    if err != nil {
        log.WithError(err).Errorf("error writing training flavour of network")
        return
    }
    ```
2.  **Consider using a dedicated configuration struct:** Instead of passing individual parameters like `input`, `hidden`, `output`, and `rate` to `CreateNetwork`, consider using a dedicated configuration struct. This can improve code readability and make it easier to add or modify configuration options in the future.

    ```go
    type NetworkConfig struct {
        Input int
        Hidden int
        Output int
        Rate float64
        Flavour imgproc.ImageAsBytesFlavour
    }

    func CreateNetwork(config NetworkConfig) *Network {
        net := &Network{
            inputs:       config.Input,
            hiddens:      config.Hidden,
            outputs:      config.Output,
            learningRate: config.Rate,
        }
        // ... rest of the code ...
    }
    ```
3.  **Make NetworkStorage private:** The `NetworkStorage` struct is only used internally by the `mlp_storage` package. Therefore, it should be made private by renaming it to `networkStorage`.
4.  **Rename pathfileNameInputToHiddenWeights**: The function `pathfileNameInputToHiddenWeights` is missleading. It is the path to the network file, not only the hidden weights. Rename the function to `pathfileNameNetwork`
    ```go
    func (net *Network) pathfileNameNetwork() string {
    	return filepath.Join(net.modelStorageFolder, "network.model")
    }
    ```
    Update the calls to that function as well.
5.  **Make flavour configurable**: The flavour should be configurable at creation time of the network.
    ```go
    func CreateNetwork(input, hidden, output int, rate float64, flavour imgproc.ImageAsBytesFlavour) *Network {
    	net := &Network{
    		inputs:       input,
    		hiddens:      hidden,
    		outputs:      output,
    		learningRate: rate,
    		flavour:      flavour,
    	}
    ```
    and update the creation in `GoSimpleAI`
    ```go
    net := CreateNetwork(inputNodes, hiddenNodes, outputNodes, learningrate, action.Flavour)
    ```
6.  **Training and prediction should depend on the flavour**: The predict and train function now have a dependency on the flavour. This parameter should be part of the `Network` struct and set during creation.

## Friendly advice
*   The refactoring seems to be on the right track towards separating the network model from the storage mechanism. Keep an eye on error handling and ensure that all potential errors are gracefully handled.
*   Consider adding unit tests for the storage-related functions to ensure that the network can be saved and loaded correctly.
*   Think about adding versioning to the stored network data. This can be useful if you later change the network structure or serialization format.
*   The AI model is persisted in a file on disk. Ensure that the directory `net.modelStorageFolder` exists, or create it if not.

## Stop when done
I am done with the review.
